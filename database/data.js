      description: "Oathkeeper is one of two Valyrian steel longswords made from Ice, the greatsword of House Stark, under orders of Lord Tywin Lannister. While initially given to Jaime Lannister by Lord Tywin with the intention of making it an heirloom of their house, Jaime instead gave it to Brienne of Tarth for the task of rescuing Sansa Stark. Its sister blade is Widow's Wail.\n\nThe sword has black and red ripples through the steel. Its scabbard glitters gold and is decorated with a row of lion's heads and smoldering red rubies. The pommel has a golden lion's head with ruby eyes that shine like two red stars."

      description: "Dragon eggs are large eggs with tiny scales, which shimmer like polished metal in the sunlight. Dragon eggs come in a variety of rich colors. The color of the eggshell appears to indicate the coloring of the dragon within: from the deep green egg, with burnished bronze flecks hatches Rhaegal, a dragon with jade-green scales and wings, and bronze eyes; from the pale cream egg streaked with gold and bronze hatches the dragon Viserion, who has golden eyes and cream-colored and golden-colored scales; from the black egg with scarlet ripples and swirls hatches the dragon Drogon, whose scales and teeth are black, and whose horns, spinal plates, and eyes are red.\n\n Dragons have been known to lay eggs in a clutch of up to at least five, and a dragon may lay several clutches during its lifetime. Although the subject of dragon mating habits is debatable, some maesters believe that if a dragon never laid an egg in its lifetime, it must be male. Whether an egg has to be fertilized by a male dragon in order to hatch is not known."
